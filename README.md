# Word Raptor Chrome Extension

## Introduction
This project is designed for English learning by fully controlling (playback, looking up words, and taking notes) your subtitles while watching your favorite videos.

Our original development plan is to support [TED](https://www.ted.com), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com), and [bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/) for our initial releases.

Currently, our project is under actively planning and development. Any ideas, issues, and PR is welcomed.

## Acknowledge
This project is inspired by [Language Reactor](https://www.languagereactor.com/).
